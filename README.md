# collabopath
The repo for https://collabopath.com

# TODO
Add the actual source code... As of right now, the source repo is a private bitbucket repo, and there were some old api keys/credentials in some of my early commits. So unfortunately, I can't just transfer the repo here. First, I'll have to make sure to get rid of all of my credentials from the source code, and then I'll add some basic documentation and transfer it over here so anyone can take a look.

# FOR NOW
This repo will just be used as an issue tracker because a lot of people had a bunch of suggestions, and I'd like anyone to be able to open issues on here so it'll be easy to keep track of them.
