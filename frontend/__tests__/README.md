## Im Sorry

writing tests is hard.

Originally, I wrote a bunch of tests, but as the game evolved I realized that all of my tests were obsolete. I tried keeping up with writing tests, but every time I wanted to add something new/change something I realized I would have had to rewrite the tests, and it was taking up a lot of time, so I just scrapped them... I'd like to get better at writing tests from the start, but it's more difficult than I anticipated.
